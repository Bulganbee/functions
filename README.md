<h1>Love Letter Generator</h1>
<p>
The <i>Love Letter Generator</i> is a project from the <i>Typography and Interaction</i> program within MPS Communication Design at Parsons, led by professors Michael Fehrenbach and Eric Li.</p>
<p>The work is part of <i>If All You Have Is a Hammer, Everything Looks Like a Nail</i> challenge, where graduate students were asked to design a solution to any problem that involves user input and generates an output.</p>
<h2>Problem statement</h2>
<p>If you’re deeply in love, how do you write a love letter that expresses the connection on a spiritual level?</p>
<h2>Solution: Love Letter Generator website</h2>
<p>Back in high school, I came across Rumi’s poetry and was drawn to the way he writes about love and spirituality. What I found most compelling was how he describes love as a deeply spiritual experience, not just something physical. For this project, I created a text generator using Rumi's poem structure and vocabulary in Javascript. I’m currently taking a Computational Form class, led by professor Justin Bakse, and during our class chapter on text, I learned how to build a random text generator that can be controlled by changing the structure, vocabulary, and grammar rules.</p>

<h2>Who is Rumi?</h2>
<p>Rumi was a 13th-century Persian poet, mystic, and Sufi philosopher known for his powerful poems about love, spirituality, and the human connection to the divine.</p>
