<h1>Love Letter Generator</h1>
<p>
The <i>Love Letter Generator</i> is a project from the <i>Typography and Interaction</i> program within MPS Communication Design at Parsons, led by professors Michael Fehrenbach and Eric Li.</p>
<p>It is part of the <i>If All You Have Is a Hammer, Everything Looks Like a Nail</i> challenge, where graduate students where asked to create a solution to any problem, which requires users to put input and create an output. </p>
<h2>Problem statement</h2>
<p>If you are madly in love, how do you create a spiritual level love letter?</p>
<h2>Solution: Rumi</h2>
<p>Back when I was in high school, I discovered Rumi's poems about love and spiritualism. What I love about his work is how he is able to define love as almost spiritual experience, rathen than just the physical. For this project, I used Rumi's poems to create a text generator using Javascript language. I am taking a Computational Form class and in our <i>Text</i> chapter, I learned to create a random text generator, which you can control with structure, vocabulary, and grammar rules. </p>
